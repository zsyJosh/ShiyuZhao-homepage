title: "End-to-end Small Molecule Entity Discovery"
summary: "A model-agnostic enhancement pipeline for small molecule property prediction. It uses a encoder and a retriever to retrieve similar molecules out of the whole dataset as supportive evidence. It also introduces a refinement stage to utilize only supportive evidence for downstream task. It will soon be sealed as a toolkit."
