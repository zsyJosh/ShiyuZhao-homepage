title: LogicGNN: Logic Message Passing Graph Neural Network
summary: The first systematically generalizable and scalable reasoning model on KG. It models one-step logic inference 
as triangle update on graph inspired by logic programming and formalize
it under the designed GNN framework. It can also identify reasonable patterns and conduct partial reasoning with the 
help of auxiliary edges on graphs.
