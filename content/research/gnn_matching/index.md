title: "Knowledge Graph System: Graph Reasoning with GNN Matching"
summary: "A graph-matching model with theoretical guarantees for human-readable rules extraction. It proposes that checking the condition of a rule is equivalent to performing subgraph isomorphism tests. It trains a graph neural network (GNN) on the line graph and exploits the trained model with matching-based grading. With high precision, the extracted rules help to provide a user-friendly interface in the system and serves as a tool for the interpretability analysis of GNN models."
