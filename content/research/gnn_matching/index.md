title: "Comprehensive and distinguishable graph-linked embedding for multi-omics single-cell data integration"
summary: "It solves the indistinguishability of aggregating multi-omics data on the graph for the graph-linked embedding. It also enriches the multi-omics information of graph embedding by using multiple aggregators in the GNN"
