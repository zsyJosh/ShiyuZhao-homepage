title: "Improvement of Random Matrix Factorization of Large-scale Network Embedding"
summary: "It improves NetMF embedding algorithm by single-view SVD, avoids storage of dense matrix and saves space. Besides, it sets the decay rate of singular value and uses freigs algorithm to speed up the factorization, achieves linear bound."
