I am currently a senior student at Yao Class, IIIS, Tsinghua University. 
My primary research interests lies in the field of knowledge discovery in AI, 
with a focus on the use of AI to effectively, efficiently, and interpretably gain knowledge in areas such as graph representation learning, natural language processing, computational biology, and cognition and reasoning.
 
I am passionate about developing AI models that can uncover generalizable knowledge from data with complex structures and logic. I also have a strong desire to explore different domains, such as biology, in order to extract transferable knowledge that can aid in domain-specific discovery and innovation.
