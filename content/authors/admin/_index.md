I am currently a senior student at Yao Class, IIIS, Tsinghua University. 
My primary research interests lies in the knowledge discovery and its borad application in graph representation learning,
natural language processing, computational biology and cognition and reasoning.
 
My goal is to build AI models to gain knowledge effectively, 
efficiently, and interpretably. I am enthusiastic about designing the 
methods to model and discover
generalizable knowledge from data with disparate formats and 
intricate logic. I am also driven to make a foray into 
different domains like biology with the hope to extract 
transferable knowledge to help with domain-specific discovery 
and innovation.
