I am currently a master student in computer science at Stanford University. I am experienced in solving complex problems in the real life through sound and creative engineering, and I am a quick learner who is always eager to explore new things! 
As for research, my previous research mainly lies in the field of knowledge discovery in AI, 
with a focus on the use of AI to effectively, efficiently, and interpretably gain knowledge in areas such as natural language processing, graph representation learning, and computational biology. 
 
I am passionate about applying my computer science skills in the real life to make a difference and developing AI models that can uncover generalizable knowledge from data with complex structures and logic.
